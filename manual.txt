Python version used:

Packages needed:

scikit-learn
numpy
matplotlib
pandas

Running code:
python main.py

Additional Comments:
In main, you may comment out create_hyperparameter_plots()
or create_size_plots() if you would like to just generate one of our experimental results.
As another note, running either experimental results function takes a while depending
on the size of the data set being used (roughly 1-10 minutes),
so commenting one of the functions out will reduce runtime significantly.

We have currently left our code for setting a random seed in lines 72-74 and 101-103 in
order for the output of our code to match the output in our final report. Comment out
these lines if you wish to see a different output.
